My first project is dedicated to project management and more specifically time involved for the next projects. 

There are 8 projects in total with theoritical aspects, such as mathematics, statistics, algorithms in Machine Learning, etc. 

Each project approach some important coding notions and environment to develop them. 

The second and third project are focused on cleaning, exploration and data vis', whereas the fourth to seventh add features engineering, machine learning problems and model creation. Regression, classification, imbalance binary class are some of the works I've done in these projects. 

You can get an eye of the projects I described in my other repositories !
